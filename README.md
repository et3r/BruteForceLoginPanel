# Bruteforce Script - Main Idea

---

This is an example of what a **Brute Force Script** with *threading*, against a **web login form**, with **no CSRF token** *required*, would look like.

I used the machine `WifinetTwo` from [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com) to execute the tests. **I'm not responsible for any misuse of this script**
